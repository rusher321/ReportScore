The goal of ReportScore is to compute the reportscore of pathway or module

## Installation

This package can be installed using [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html).

```r
devtools::install_github('rusher321/ReportScore@master')
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ReportScore)

## basic example code
pr <- read.table("test/test.profile.txt",row.names = 1,header = T,sep = "\t")
grp <- read.table("test/test.group.txt",row.names = 1,header = T,sep = "\t")
res <- ReporterScore(pr, grp, paired = T, database = "./database")

## if you want update the datebase 
download_data(db_dir = "database/")

## if you want plot the output
fig <- ReportVis(res, color = c("#2470a0", "#DE3C3C"), exclude = T)

## the **test.R** have real data can to test

```
## Figure 
the output like ![this](fig/test.png)
